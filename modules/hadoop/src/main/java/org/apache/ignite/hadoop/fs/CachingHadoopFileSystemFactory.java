/**
 * Caching Hadoop file system factory. Caches {@code FileSystem} instances on per-user basis. Doesn't rely on
 * built-in Hadoop {@code FileSystem} caching mechanics. Separate {@code FileSystem} instance is created for each
 * user instead.
 * <p>
 * This makes cache instance resistant to concurrent calls to {@code FileSystem.close()} in other parts of the user
 * code. On the other hand, this might cause problems on some environments. E.g. if Kerberos is enabled, a call to
 * {@code FileSystem.get(URI, Configuration, String)} will refresh Kerberos token. But this factory implementation
 * calls this method only once per user what may lead to token expiration. In such cases it makes sense to either
 * use {@link BasicHadoopFileSystemFactory} or implement your own factory.
