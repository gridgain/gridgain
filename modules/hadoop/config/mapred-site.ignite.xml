<!--
    This template file contains settings needed to run Apache Hadoop jobs
    with Apache Ignite In-Memory Accelerator.

    You can replace '$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml' file with this one
    to run jobs on localhost (local node can be a part of distributed cluster though).
    To run jobs on remote host you have to change jobtracker address to the REST address
    of any running Ignite node.

    Note that Ignite jars must be in Apache Hadoop client classpath to work
    with this configuration.

    Run script '$IGNITE_HOME/bin/setup-hadoop.{sh|bat}' for Apache Hadoop client setup.
